# Max Simulation: Facing Spooks

Aaa terminal based philosophical test inspired by Max Stirner’s “The Ego and Its Own”
so who even was Max Stirner?

**Max Stirner**

Johann Kaspar Schmidt (25 October 1806 – 26 June 1856), better known as **Max Stirner** which means *“forehead”* in German.  
Yeah, the guy who shook up philosophy was literally named after a forehead. and basically decides to looked at society and said:

>**Ich bin meine Gattung, bin ohne Norm, ohne Gesetz, ohne Muster und dergleichen.**

i’ve actually read his book “The Ego and Its Own” in my native Arabic, in English, and even in German which was a total nightmare trying to decipher that 1800s German with my B1 level!!!

**His book is:**

i could say:
>wildly misunderstood,

>way harder to read than your ex’s mixed signals,

>and basically a philosophical bomb aimed at everything people hold sacred.

## So what’s his philosophy?

In a nutshell: Everything is a spook.
Not just religion or government, but ideas like morality, duty, humanity, or even… love.
If it controls you but isn’t you, it’s a ghost haunting your mind, haunting you. 

**Stirner vs. Hegel**

Stirner came from the Hegelian school, where philosophers argued about the Absolute Spirit and how history was some grand unfolding story.

Hegel was like:

>"History is this epic journey of Spirit realizing itself!"

Stirner’s response?

>“Maaan, spirit? i’m just trying to figure out who I am.”

While Hegel built massive, twisting systems, Stirner threw his hands up and said:

**“Forget your universal spirit, I’m my own boss.”**

It was the original philosophical mic drop, and maybe the first big beef in German idealism.

# His Death (seriously this mf?)

Stirner died in 1856 because of an infected insect bite.

Yep. The guy who tore apart every sacred idea got taken down by a mosquito.
Some say it’s poetic irony. Others joke it was Hegel’s last revenge.
And a few whisper:

>“he became the bug...”
    

# What Is This Max Simulation?

it’s a terminal based simulation that throws you into 15 tough scenarios inspired by Stirner’s chaotic worldview.

>Will you follow the rules? Or will you say “nah” and grab whatever?

Every choice affects your Ego Profile across these traits:

   - Awareness:  Can you spot the ideological nonsense?

   - Ownness: Are you truly your own person?

   - Rebellion: Will you resist the “sacred” commands?

   - Submission: How easily do you fold?

   - Fear Factor: Are you spooked into obedience?

At the end, Max Stirner himself (ghost or not) judges you.
Are you free or just another puppet dancing for ghosts?

## Installation
 Get the files somehow,
 compile this shit:
 
    make

## Or do it manually:
    gcc main.c ego.c spook.c judgment.c -o Maxsim


## What’s Next?**

this thing is just a simple easy test of an idea i’ve been obsessed with.
The plan is to build a full philosophical game where players battle “spooks,” break free from ideology, and maybe even debate Hegel’s ghost.

so yeah. Welcome to the simulation.

no gods.
no masters.
just ego.
